      <h2>About SportsWorld</h2>
      <h1>
        SportsWorld was launched in 1997 on the back of a World Cup that England hadn’t even qualified for.
        <br>It was an act of madness… but it somehow worked out.
        <br><br>
        Almost 25 years on, SportsWorld is the world’s biggest football magazine, <br>published in 17 markets, with a
        digital portfolio that includes an iPad and iPhone magazine app,<br> a website offering advice on playing the
        game
        better - and this, our website.
        <br><br>
        Our mission is to offer our intelligent, international audience access to the game’s biggest names, insightful<br>
        analysis, and a bit of a giggle. We unashamedly love this game and we hope that our coverage reflects that.
